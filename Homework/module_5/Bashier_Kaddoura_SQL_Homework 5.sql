-- String manipulations
/* 1. Some product names in the product table have descriptions like "Jar" or "Organic". 
These are separated from the product name with a hyphen. 
Create a column using SUBSTR (and a couple of other commands) that captures these, but is otherwise NULL. 
Remove any trailing or leading whitespaces. Don't just use a case statement for each product! 

| product_name               | description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Habanero Peppers - Organic | Organic     |

Hint: you might need to use INSTR(product_name,'-') to find the hyphens. INSTR will help split the column. */

SELECT *
,SUBSTR(product_name, INSTR(product_name,'-') +2) as description

FROM product


/* 2. Filter the query to show any product_size value that contain a number with REGEXP. */



-- UNION
/* 1. Using a UNION, write a query that displays the market dates with the highest and lowest total sales.

HINT: There are a possibly a few ways to do this query, but if you're struggling, try the following: 
1) Create a CTE/Temp Table to find sales values grouped dates; 
2) Create another CTE/Temp table with a rank windowed function on the previous query to create 
"best day" and "worst day"; 
3) Query the second temp table twice, once for the best day, once for the worst day, 
with a UNION binding them. */



-- Cross Join
/*1. Suppose every vendor in the `vendor_inventory` table had 5 of each of their products to sell to 
**every** customer on record. How much money would each vendor make per product? 
Show this by vendor_name and product name, rather than using the IDs.

HINT: Be sure you select only relevant columns and rows. 
Remember, CROSS JOIN will explode your table rows, so CROSS JOIN should likely be a subquery. 
Think a bit about the row counts: how many distinct vendors, product names are there (x)?
How many customers are there (y). 
Before your final group by you should have the product of those two queries (x*y).  */

SELECT DISTINCT vendor_name, product_name, (5 * original_price * total_customers) as price
FROM vendor_inventory vi 
JOIN vendor v on v.vendor_id = vi.vendor_id
JOIN product p on p.product_id = vi.product_id
CROSS JOIN (
SELECT COUNT(customer_id) as [total_customers]
FROM customer
)

-- INSERT
/*1.  Create a new table "product_units". 
This table will contain only products where the `product_qty_type = 'unit'`. 
It should use all of the columns from the product table, as well as a new column for the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.  
Name the timestamp column `snapshot_timestamp`. */

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp.product_units; 
CREATE TEMP TABLE IF NOT EXISTS product_units as
SELECT p.*,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as snapshot_timestamp
FROM product as p

/*2. Using `INSERT`, add a new row to the product_units table (with an updated timestamp). 
This can be any product you desire (e.g. add another record for Apple Pie). */

INSERT INTO product_units
VALUES(15,'Pork Chops', '1 lb', 6, 'unit', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);



-- DELETE
/* 1. Delete the older record for the whatever product you added. 

HINT: If you don't specify a WHERE clause, you are going to have a bad time.*/

DELETE FROM product_units
WHERE product_id = 23
AND snapshot_timestamp = '2024-03-18 06:55:10'


-- UPDATE
/* 1.We want to add the current_quantity to the product_units table. 
First, add a new column, current_quantity to the table using the following syntax.

ALTER TABLE product_units
ADD current_quantity INT;

Then, using UPDATE, change the current_quantity equal to the last quantity value from the vendor_inventory details.

HINT: This one is pretty hard. 
First, determine how to get the "last" quantity per product. 
Second, coalesce null values to 0 (if you don't have null values, figure out how to rearrange your query so you do.) 
Third, SET current_quantity = (...your select statement...), remembering that WHERE can only accommodate one column. 
Finally, make sure you have a WHERE statement to update the right row, 
	you'll need to use product_units.product_id to refer to the correct row within the product_units table. 
When you have all of these components, you can run the update statement. */
